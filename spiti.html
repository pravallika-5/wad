            <h2> <a href="spitioverview.html">Discover Spiti</a></h2>
            <p>"Spiti Valley, often referred to as 'Little Tibet,' is a remote and mystical destination
                 in Himachal Pradesh, known for its stark landscapes, ancient monasteries, and peaceful Tibetan culture.".</p>
            <p>Spiti Valley is located in the northern part of Himachal Pradesh, bordering the Tibetan
                 plateau, and lies at an average altitude of around 12,500 feet above sea level. It is a high-altitude desert,
                  surrounded by the mighty Himalayas to the south and the Zanskar Range to the north, which gives the region its 
                  arid yet stunning landscape. The valley is cut off from the rest of the world during the harsh winter months due 
                  to heavy snowfall in the surrounding passes. Spiti is primarily inhabited by Buddhists, and the valley features
                   several ancient monasteries, such as Key Monastery and Tabo Monastery, making it not just a geographical wonder 
                   but also a spiritual hub. The valley is connected to the rest of the state by Kunzum Pass and Rohtang Pass, though 
                   it remains relatively isolated due to its rugged terrain and remote location.</p>

                                        <li>This is the best time for road trips, trekking, and exploring the valley's unique culture, as the roads are accessible and the weather is pleasant.</li>
                                        <li>Ideal for visiting popular attractions such as **Key Monastery**, **Tabo Monastery**, and **Chandratal Lake** while experiencing the vibrant Tibetan festivals.</li>
                                        <li>Perfect for trekking expeditions to **Pin Valley** and **Parang La Pass**. The region’s flora and fauna are also more visible during this time.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Monsoon (July to August)</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Monsoon brings some rainfall to Spiti, but the region is relatively dry compared to other parts of Himachal Pradesh.</li>
                                        <li>However, the roads can be slippery, and some routes might be blocked due to landslides, making it a less favorable time to visit.</li>
                                        <li>The lush green landscapes during monsoon add beauty to the valley, though caution is needed for travelers.</li>
                                        <li>Monsoon is a quieter season for tourism, so those looking for solitude might find it appealing, but it’s not ideal for outdoor activities.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                        <li>This period offers an ideal balance of good weather and fewer tourists. The valley is especially beautiful as the leaves turn golden, and the landscape takes on a vibrant hue.</li>
                                        <li>Great for trekking, especially in the **Pin Valley National Park** and visiting the **Spiti River Valley** as the roads remain clear, and the weather is perfect for sightseeing and outdoor activities.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Winter brings harsh, cold conditions with temperatures dropping well below freezing. While this is not the most popular time to visit, it offers a different experience.</li>
                                        <li>Visitors can experience the beauty of Spiti covered in snow, creating a winter wonderland. However, travel during this time is only for the most adventurous as most routes are blocked by snow.</li>

                                        <li>Winter sports such as snow trekking and ice climbing are popular, but the harsh conditions make this a less accessible season for most travelers.</li>
