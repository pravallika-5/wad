        <h2 class="sub-heading">History and Significance of Jim Corbett National Park
</h2>
        <div class="divi3"></div>
        <p>

Jim Corbett National Park holds a special place in India’s conservation history as the country’s first national park, established in **1936** as **Hailey National Park**. Named after Sir Malcolm Hailey, the then-Governor of the United Provinces (now Uttarakhand), the park initially covered around **323 square kilometers**. In the following years, as conservation awareness grew, the park’s area was expanded, and it was later renamed after **Jim Corbett** in **1957** to honor the legendary hunter, conservationist, and author who advocated for wildlife protection in India.

Jim Corbett, a British-Indian hunter-turned-naturalist, became famous for hunting man-eating tigers and leopards in the Kumaon and Garhwal regions. However, as he witnessed the decline in tiger populations, he became a passionate conservationist and worked tirelessly to preserve the region’s wildlife. Corbett’s advocacy for tiger conservation and his efforts to establish protected areas were instrumental in the park's creation. His books, such as *Man-Eaters of Kumaon*, captured his experiences and brought global attention to the need for wildlife conservation.

In **1973**, Jim Corbett National Park gained even greater significance when it became the first park to come under **Project Tiger**, a landmark initiative by the Indian government to protect the endangered Bengal tiger population. Project Tiger helped transform the park into a dedicated sanctuary for tigers and sparked nationwide efforts to save this iconic species. Corbett National Park thus became a model for conservation in India, focusing on protecting tiger habitats and ecosystems.

Today, the park stands as one of India’s most important wildlife reserves, not only for its tiger population but also for its role in preserving biodiversity in the Himalayan foothills. Home to a variety of animals, including elephants, leopards, deer, otters, and over **580 bird species**, Jim Corbett National Park is a vital ecosystem for endangered and threatened species.

The park’s significance extends beyond conservation; it plays a crucial role in **eco-tourism** in India, drawing nature lovers, wildlife photographers, and adventure enthusiasts from around the world. With its rich history, connection to Jim Corbett’s legacy, and continued success in tiger conservation, Jim Corbett National Park remains a symbol of India’s commitment to wildlife preservation and a testament to the vision of one of the country’s earliest conservationists.</p>
