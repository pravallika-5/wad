            <p>"Darjeeling, often referred to as the 'Queen of the Hills,' is a picturesque hill station in West Bengal, 
                famous for its tea gardens, breathtaking views of the Kanchenjunga mountain range, and its charming colonial architecture."</p>
           <p> Darjeeling is located in the northeastern part of India, nestled in the Himalayas at an altitude of 
            about 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) above sea level. It is situated in the state of West Bengal, near the borders 
            of Nepal and Bhutan, and is surrounded by lush green hills and tea plantations. The town offers a panoramic
             view of the mighty Kanchenjunga, the third-highest mountain in the world. Darjeeling is part of the Darjeeling district,
              and it lies at the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas. The town is also known for its proximity to the Sikkim state,
               providing travelers with a blend of different cultural influences, including Tibetan, Nepali, and Bengali. Its cool climate,
                rich biodiversity, and colonial-era charm make it a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of the plains.</p>
