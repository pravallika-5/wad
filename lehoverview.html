        <div class="divi1"></div>
        <p>
Leh-Ladakh is situated in the northernmost part of India within the union territory of Ladakh, bordered by the Great Himalayas to the south and the Karakoram Range to the north. The region lies at an elevation of approximately 11,500 feet (3,500 meters) above sea level, with some peaks and passes reaching over 18,000 feet. The landscape is characterized by arid deserts, towering mountains, deep valleys, and high-altitude lakes, creating a unique, rugged beauty that is distinctive to Ladakh.

The climate of Leh-Ladakh is harsh and extreme due to its high-altitude desert environment. Winters are long and severe, with temperatures plunging well below freezing, often reaching -30°C or lower from November to March. Snowfall is common, and many roads and passes, including the famous Khardung La, close due to heavy snow. Summers, from May to September, bring relatively mild temperatures, with daytime highs reaching around 20-25°C, making it the best season to visit. However, the nights remain cold, even in summer. The region receives minimal rainfall due to the rain shadow effect caused by the surrounding mountains, giving it a dry, desert-like climate with clear skies and abundant sunshine throughout much of the year. 

These unique geographic and climatic conditions make Leh-Ladakh a fascinating destination, offering landscapes and experiences distinct from any other part of India.</p>
