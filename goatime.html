        <h1>Best Time to Visit Goa</h1>
        <p>Goa is best visited between <strong>November and February</strong>, when the weather is pleasantly warm and ideal for beach outings and festivals.</p>
        <h2>Seasonal Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Winter (Nov-Feb):</strong> The ideal time for beach activities, festivals, and nightlife. Expect more traffic due to the high tourist season.</li>
            <li><strong>Summer (Mar-May):</strong> Hot and humid, with fewer tourists. Good for budget travel.</li>
            <li><strong>Monsoon (Jun-Oct):</strong> Rainy, lush landscapes, and lower hotel rates. Not ideal for beach outings but great for scenic views and off-season discounts.</li>
